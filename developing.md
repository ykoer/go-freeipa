# go-freeipa development guide

## Generation process

```
ipalib source --> (dump-errors) --> errors.json ----\
                                                     |--> (gen) --> generated.go
FreeIPA instance --> (dump-schema) --> schema.json -/
             
```

The above diagram shows the different steps to create the generated code. The
results of each of these steps (`errors.json`, `schema.json` and `generated.go`)
are all committed, so these steps do not have to be run by users of the library.
This document explains what each step does and how to execute it.

### dump-errors step

The `dump-schema` call does not return any information about possible error codes
(eg. `401 NotFound`). This is generated by `./dump-errors/dump.py` and saved to
`./data/errors.json`. This script requires Python 3, but has no other
dependencies. It downloads `ipalib/errors.py` from a fixed commit on GitHub,
imports it and extracts error codes from the classes which define them. You will
probably want to adjust `ERRORS_PY_URL` to point to a newer commit.

This step has been automated using the Makefile.  To use it, make sure the IPA_HOST
and COOKIE values are correct (you **will** have to update the cookie value.),
then run:

    make dump-errors

### dump-schema step

FreeIPA exposes two API methods for getting a description of the API.

There is the `json_metadata` method, which is used by the official web UI to
show the "API browser". The data returned by this method is not useful, since it
does not describe any method responses (only requests).

There is also a `schema` method, which is called by the official CLI on first
start. This has a slightly different structure, but notably also describes
method responses. This is the method used to generate this library.

To regenerate `data/schema.json`: Frist, start a FreeIPA server (for example
[with Docker](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Docker)). Then, log in to the web UI
in your browser and copy your `ipa_session` cookie. 

The exact process varies by browser, but this is how you get the value in Google Chrome.

- Log into the ipa host ui.
- Right click on the page and select 'Inspect.'
- On the left, click on Cookies, and select the one for your host.
- Find the one named 'ipa_session.'
- Double click on the 'value' for that cookie, and copy it.

Finally, make a request like the following curl command does:

```bash
curl 'https://dc1.test.local/ipa/session/json' -H 'Origin: https://dc1.test.local' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Cookie: ipa_session=3057327ac9ea5622d7011b122d47790e' -H 'Referer: https://dc1.test.local/ipa/ui/' --data-binary '{"method":"schema","params":[[],{"version":"2.170"}]}' --insecure > ./data/schema.json
```

You'll need to adjust the URLs and the value of the `ipa_session` cookie. You
may alse need to adjust `version` in the request body.

This step has been automated using the Makefile.  To use it, make sure the IPA_HOST
value is correct, then run:

    make dump-schema


### `gen` step

`gen` is a golang package which uses `text/template` to create
`freeipa/generated.go` using both `.json` files. It should be run from the
`./gen` directory.

To run it:

1. Change to the gen directory
1. run `go run ./...`


This step has been automated using the Makefile.  To use it, make sure the IPA_HOST
and COOKIE values are correct (you **will** have to update the cookie value.),
then run:

    make gen

NOTE: this command will also download the schema and errors files.


## Common tasks

### Adjusting generated code

To adjust the generated code, without changing the targeted FreeIPA version, edit
`gen/freeipa.gotmpl`, then perform the `gen` step from above.

### Targeting a newer FreeIPA version

To change the targeted FreeIPA version, you need to first need to perform the
`dump-errors` step and the `dump-schema` step. Afterwards, you need to perform the
`gen` step.
